```bash
tesseract image.png -o output/myoutput
```

This will create a file called "myoutput.txt" in the "output" directory, containing the recognized text.

```bash
brew install tesseract-lang

tesseract image.png output -l ara
```

```bash
tesseract input.png output -l ara+eng
```

This will create a file called "output.txt" containing the text that was recognized by Tesseract in both Arabic and English.
