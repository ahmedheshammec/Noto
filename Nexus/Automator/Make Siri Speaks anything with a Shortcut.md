→ Set the workflow to receive `text` in `any application` 

paste the following shell code: 

```sh
say "$@"
```

→ Make sure you have a nice Siri voice downloaded in the spoken content section in system preferences. 

→ Go to system preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Select Services from the side panel > Scroll down to text and Expand it > Select our Siri Speak action and set a shortcut like ⌘ + F6 for example

→ Now you have a text-to-speech engine with a single keyboard shortcut.
