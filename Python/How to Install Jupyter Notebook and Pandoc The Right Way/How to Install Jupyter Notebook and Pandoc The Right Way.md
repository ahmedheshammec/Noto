* if you have multiple python installed via homebrew uninstall every one of them and uninstall brew completely, don't worry we will install it back after we finish. 
* we will use the integrated python in mac os which was in my case python 3.9.6; you can check which version by running: 
```plaintext
python -V
```
* since we're using the integrated version of python we will get rid of the following error when installing packages thgrough pip: 
`externally managed environment`
* Now let's install pandoc
```plaintext
pip install pandoc
```
* and let's install jupyter
```plaintext
pip install jupyter
```
* now cd into the location of your jupyter notebooks and type: 
```plaintext
jupyter notebook
```
This will start the Jupyter Notebook server, and a new browser window or tab will open with the Jupyter Notebook interface.
* now run this command: 
```plaintext
sudo tlmgr install lmodern
```
* and this command
```plaintext
sudo tlmgr update --self
```
* Now open the notebook in your browser, you can download them as html, markdown just fine.

* now for the pdf we will use the `webpdf` option but before that we need to install chromium, so will install it using `playwright` command 
```plaintext
pip install playwright
```
```plaintext
playwright install chromium
```
* now refresh the page and choose webpdf option again.
