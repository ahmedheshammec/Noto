* Go to your unwanted blank page, click as close to the bottom of the page as you can get, and press your backspace key until the page is removed.
* Go to the VIEW tab, select Navigation Pane in the Show section, select the blank page thumbnail in the left panel, and press your delete key until it is removed.
* If there is a table at the end of your document, Word will automatically insert a paragraph after it, often resulting in a blank page at the end, to solve this go to the first line in the blank page and make the font size super small like 1 point, this will force Word to delete that blank page
