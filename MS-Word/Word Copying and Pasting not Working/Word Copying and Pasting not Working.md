**First Method**
Go to File >> Options >> Language Tab >> Maneuver to this section "Choose Display and Help Language" >>
Set the Display Language and Help Language to English and Click "Set as Default" and click OK >> restart MS_Word and voila the Shortcuts are backÂ 
**Second Method**
Sometimes The First Method doesn't work or the problem keeps coming back to, so here's another Fix:
* Go to word options (small arrow down at the top> more commands)
* Then go to Customize
* In the left side of windows, find "customize the Ribbon" Tab
* Then, just scroll straight down to select Reset.
* And then choose "reset all customizations on the drop down menu"
* Do The Same Exact Steps With The "Quick Access Toolbar" Tab
* Having done that, select ok.... and you are done.

**Third Method**
if the above methods didn't work and your shortcuts still not working, make sure before you open MS-Word that the keyboard language in windows is set to "English"
