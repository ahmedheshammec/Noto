### Debugging

Here's some useful terminal commands used in the debugging: 

‚Üí **Redirect to a log**

```
pip install libsass==0.17.0 > log.txt 2>&1
```

‚Üí **Copy log content to clipboard**

```
cat log.txt | pbcopy
```

‚Üí **Uninstall a specific Package**

```
pip uninstall lxml==4.5.0
```

‚Üí **List a Specific Package From Pip List**

```
pip list | grep "lxml"
```

### Best Workflow to Fix Setup Errors

1- start by creating a virtual environment then activate it using a recommended python version for the odoo server you want to run (Scroll Down for Code üëá)

2- Run the following command

```
pip install -e .
```

‚Üí If you got errors running this command, switch to a different version of python until it gives you no errors. 

‚Üí After running this command open `requirements.txt` and open the output of the `pip list` command **side by side** in vs-code. 

‚Üí Go through each package in the requirements and see if it's installed in the pip list output, if it's not installed install it. 

‚Üí After you're done with list try running the server with the **base** module using the following command: 

```
python odoo-bin -c odoo13-bahy.conf -d odoo13-bahy -i base
```

**PS** you might get some errors at this point related to some packages needs to downgraded to a compatible module. in this case delete the installed version, install the compatible one, and retry.

‚Üí Now if you're successful running the base module try running the following command: 

```
python odoo-bin -c odoo13-bahy.conf -d odoo13-bahy
```

‚Üí Now you're good to go üëç üöÄ

‚ùñ To delete every installed pip package on your environment run: 

```
pip freeze | xargs pip uninstall -y
```

‚ùñ To Make Everything Run Smooth Create a Virtual Environment Inside Odoo Folder Using the Following Command: 

```
python -m venv .venv
```

‚ùñ This Will Create a Hidden `Venv` File in the Odoo Odoo, Now We Need to Activate It

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

‚ùñ Now Let's Check that There's No Lists Installed Using the Following Command: 

```
python -m pip list
```

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

‚ùñ Next Let's Install the Requirements in the requirements.txt File Using the Following Command: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or try the following command with different python versions: 

```
pip install -e .
```

Which Installs the current project in editable mode

‚Üí You may need to install the following: 

```
pip install "lxml[html_clean]"
pip install lxml_html_clean
pip install gevent psycopg2-binary pillow reportlab python-ldap num2words xlwt
```

‚ùñ Next Add the Following Lines in the Config Under the Debian Directory: 

```
limit_memory_hard = 0
limit_memory_soft = 0
```

‚ùñ Now Let's Launch the Server:

```
python odoo-bin -c /Users/Ahmed/Documents/odoo15-15.0/debian/odoo.conf
```

‚ùñ If You Encountered a Problem Like This: `ValueError: current limit exceeds maximum limit`  Do the Following:
1. Open Terminal.
2. Type `sudo -i` and enter your password to switch to the root user.
3. Type `launchctl limit maxfiles` to check the current limit on the maximum number of open files.
4. Type `launchctl limit maxfiles 65536 200000` to set the limit to 65536 for the current session and 200000 for future sessions.
5. Type `launchctl limit maxproc` to check the current limit on the maximum number of processes.
6. Type `launchctl limit maxproc 2048 4096` to set the limit to 2048 for the current session and 4096 for future sessions.
7. Type `ulimit -n` to check the current limit on the maximum number of open file descriptors.
8. Type `ulimit -n 65536` to set the limit to 65536.
9. Type `exit` to switch back to your regular user account.

### Installing Postgres@13
This Is the Version of Postgres that Is Specifically Mentioned in Odoo's Documentation and Is Known to Be Compatible and Stable with Odoo 15.
To Install Use the Following Command: 

```
brew install postgresql@13
```

To Check the Version of Postgres Currently Running Type:

```
psql --version
```


:: __`If I Have Postgres 16 and 13 How Can I Move Back and Forth Between the Two ?`__ ::
‚ùñ First Let's Stop the Postgres 16 Service:

```
brew services stop postgresql@16
```

‚ùñ Now Let's Start the Postgres 13 Service:

```
services start postgresql@13
```

next we need to link `psql` command to postgres13 not 16, we can set it manually like this: 

```
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/postgresql@13/13.15/bin:$PATH"
```

But for Convenience We Will Add the Following Alieases to Our `.zshrc` File: 

```
# postgres aliases
alias use_postgres_13='export PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/postgresql@13/13.15/bin:$PATH"'
alias use_postgres_16='export PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/postgresql@16/16.2_1/bin:$PATH"'
```

Now You Can Use Any of the Aliases to Go Back and Forth Between Different Versions of Postgres.
also you can check the running postgres using the following command: 

```
psql --version
```

next you need to create role odoo in in the postgres and give it permission to create database.
if you encounter the following error: `OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use ` you need to shut down the processes that uses 8069 port.

The problem is with cryptography and pyopenssl libraries.change requirements.txt as:
go to terminal and:
`pip uninstall pyopenssl`
`pip install pyopenssl==22.0.0`
`pip uninstall cryptography`
`pip install cryptography==37.0.0`
