To find the size of a directory or file in the terminal, use the
"du' (disk usage) command. For example:
```plaintext
du -sh path/to/directory/or/file
```
The -s option summarizes the total size of the directory or file, while the "-h' option makes the output human-readable (e.g. "1G" instead of "1000000000").
