Alfred ( Mac - Â£17 to unlock feature required to do this )

Automator does this same thing quite well, but I always have to mention Alfred, since it has a few benefits:

You got the workflow and the hotkey in one place.
Store multiple shortcuts in one place. In this screenshot I'm triggering the script file with applescript, but Alfred does have a "Open file" action too.
You can trigger scripts and do other things by using keywords.
File Filters - Here's a Gif where I'm using a file filter to search my Photoshop scripts stored in a specific Dropbox folder. It uses a fuzzy search so you only have to remember one word in the script name in order to find it. Excellent if you got tons of scripts. Makes it a lot easier to use scripts that you don't use very often.
It can sync workflows through Dropbox, so you can easily use the same scripts and the same shortcuts on a new computer just by installing Dropbox and Alfred.
Recently made a video about this. Not the best video quality. Forgot to record it full screen.

Alfred Preferences > Workflows tab
From the bottom left: Click the + icon and add Blank Workflow
Give it a descriptive Workflow Name: and press Create
From the top right: Click the + Icon and add Triggers > Hotkey
In the first tab Hotkey settings, set a hotkey combination
In the second tab Related Apps, drag Illustrator.app inside the window and Save
From the top right: Click the + Icon and add Actions > Open File
Drag your .jsx file to that first box on the left
Drag Illustrator.app to the second box on the right and Save
Drag a line from the right side of the Trigger to the left side of the Action to connect them.
