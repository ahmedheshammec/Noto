**here's a handy expression to help you offsetting your objects animation by any time you want; first the keyframes must be equal and the expression will do the offseting for us, just type: 
> valueAtTime(t)￼
the "t" represent the time; so if you want to offset your animation by 1 second for example the expression will be like this: 
> valueAtTime(time-1)￼
