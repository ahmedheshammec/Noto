To replace thisComp with another comp, you need to replace thisComp with the name of the desired comp in the expression. You can do this by using the comp () function in the expression.
For example, if you want to replace thisComp with a comp named "MyComp", you can modify the expression as follows:
```plaintext
if(comp ("MyComp").layer("edit style of point 03").effect("Style (1-28)") ("ADBE Slider Control-0001")==15)100 else 0:
```
Make sure to replace "MyComp" with the actual name of the desired comp.
