**variables is very helpful trick you can use all the time to link multiple properties together; so you can say:
> a=thisComp.layer("Adjustment Layer 1").effect("offset X ")("Slider");￼
this mean that the letter "A" or "The Variable" is refering to a value which we can use later like this: 
> position+a￼
this means that we're telling Ae to take the position value and add "a" to it
