unlike wiggle, the random expression is good at keeping the animation locked between two values, and not exceeding those values. it's not looking at the current frame like wiggle does. 
the basic form goes like this: 
```plaintext
random();
```
this will return a value between 0 and 1 

```plaintext
random(100);
```
this will return a value between zero and whatever number between the parentheses. 

```plaintext
random(25,100)
```
 this will return a value between the two numbers inside the parentheses.
