here's a handy expression to help you offset your objects animation by any time you want; first the keyframes must be equal and the expression will do the offsetting for us, just type: 
```plaintext
valueAtTime(t)
```
the "t" represents the time, so if you want to offset your animation by 1 second for example; the expression will be like this: 
```plaintext
valueAtTime(time-1)
```
