and we can edit those from this color panel here in the top right corner.

so here for example in luma, you should be between 0 and 100. 
::Color Grading:: here we can apply LUTs (look up table). and you can apply LUTs by going to the effects panel and typing custom LUT and dragging it to your footage.
