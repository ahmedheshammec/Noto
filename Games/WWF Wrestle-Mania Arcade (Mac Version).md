→ when you first run the app you won't have any controls but the basic movements. to configure the controls press `Control ⌃ + Shift ⇧ + 1 ` to setup controls for player one, and `Control ⌃ + Shift ⇧ + 2` for player two. 

→ you will be prompted to press keys like right, left, up, ..etc. but you will see a number like this: (1) the first time you setup a key then it will go to two (2). this behaviour is a feature to map the same key to multiple keystrokes. but in our case we will press the same keystroke for (1) and (2). 

→ When you prompted to map the start put it to the letter P for Pause as this start button will pause the game just like in normal controllers. 

→ Set the rest of the controls like this: 

- up → w
- down → s
- right → d
- left → a
- a → j
- rapid a → u
- b → k
- rapid b → i
- c → l 
- rapid c → o
