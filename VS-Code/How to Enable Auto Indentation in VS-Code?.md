This Option auto-indent automatically when you press return based on the previous line indentation. 

❖ Open **Settings** (you can press Ctrl + , or Cmd + , on macOS).

❖ Search for **“Auto Indent”** and ensure the setting **Editor: Auto Indent** is set to full or advanced. This helps VS Code automatically indent new lines based on the current line.
