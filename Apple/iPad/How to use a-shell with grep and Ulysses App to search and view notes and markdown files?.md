→ move your notes folder into the `a-shell` folder on your iPad. 

→ use the following command in a-shell to search for stuff: 

```sh
grep -r -i "gui file manager" .
```

`-r` for recursive searching. 

`-i` to ignore case sensitivity. 

`.` search starting from the current directory. 

→ the grep command will print the outputs including the notes location that has this string matched. 

→ go to the files app and manually go the location of that note and share it to the Ulysses app it will open up and show the code blocks just right.
