To eject a removable disk from the terminal on your Mac, you can use the `diskutil` command. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Identify the disk**:
   - Open Terminal and type the following command to list all disks and find the identifier for your removable disk (e.g., `/dev/disk2`):

```bash
 diskutil list
```

   - This will display a list of all disks. Look for your removable disk in the list by name, size, or type (e.g., USB drive).

2. **Eject the disk**:
   - Once you've identified the disk (e.g., `/dev/disk2`), use the following command to eject it:

```bash
diskutil eject /dev/disk2
```

   - Replace `/dev/disk2` with the correct disk identifier for your removable disk.

The disk should now be ejected. If you receive an error or if the disk is in use, make sure that no files or applications are actively using it before attempting to eject again.
