There's Two Ways to Do It: 

#### First Method (From the Settings and Requires Logging Out of Apple Id): 

❖ This Method Doesn't Require Internet Connection

open `System Settings` → General → Transfer or Reset → Erase All Content and Settings

#### Second Method (Full Erase From the Recovery): 

❖ This Method Requires Internet Connection to Re-Install Mac Os as We're About to Erase the Whole Hard Drive. 

❖ Close Your Mac and Keep Pressing the Power Button Until You See the Startup Options

❖ Erase Your Mac Drive From the Disk Utility

❖ Close the Disk Utility and Choose Re-Install Mac Os (This Will Download the Mac Os From Apple Servers Which Requires Good Internet Connection Cuz This Process Will Take a Good Time to Finish)
