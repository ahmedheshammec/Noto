How i solved the download icon bug: Very weird, but i just copied the original icon from the original download folder and pasted it back again (but with a step in between, so the metadata is not the same):
	- open folder info panel: CMD + I
	- select folder icon on top left so it is outlined
	- CMD + C
	- open photoshop, create new file (right dimensions are pre-selected), paste with CMD + V, select all with CMD + A, copy again with CMD + C [alternatively, you can download an icon somewhere from the internet like [macosicons.com](macosicons.com)ï¿¼ and drag it right into the info panel icon]
	- go back to folder info, select icon again so you see the outline again and paste with CMD + V
	- done, now create alias and drag into dock.

I know that not everybody has Photoshop, but that's what worked for me. I tried with preview as well, but it seems it does not recognise the image data.

I'm happy that it is solved and i could help you.
